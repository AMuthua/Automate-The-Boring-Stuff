# Consider this story about the mathematician:-
#       Karl Friedrich Gauss.
#   Gauss figured out that:-
#       There were 50 pairs of numbers that added up to 100:
#       1 + 99, 2 + 98, 3 + 97, and so on, until 49 + 51.
#       Since 50 Ã— 100 is 5,000
#       When you add that middle 50
#       The sum of all the numbers from 0 to 100 is 5,050.
